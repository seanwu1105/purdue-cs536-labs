# [Lab 2: Basic Socket Programming and Timed Client/Server Interaction](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/park/cs536/lab2/lab2.html)

## Objective

The objective of this lab is to practice basic network programming using
datagram and stream sockets. We will utilize coarse timers and manage
synchronous and asynchronous events to facilitate timed client/server
interaction. This lab is an individual effort. Please note the assignment
submission policy specified on the course home page.

## Reading

Read chapter 2 from Peterson & Davie (textbook).
