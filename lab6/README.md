# [Lab 6: Application Layer Routing](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/park/cs536/lab6/lab6.html)

## Objective

In this lab, we will investigate basic techniques underlying application layer
routing that are used to implement infrastructure network services such as
virtual private networks (VPNs) and overlay networks. The key element is
different forms of network tunneling that enable a measure of user control over
packet forwarding and resultant routes that packets traverse. The creation of
virtual networks over physical networks has myriad applications. For example,
anonymity facilitated by overlay networks may be used by an hacker to hide its
true location which slows down mitigation of an attack.

## Reading

Read chapters 7, 8 and 9 from Peterson & Davie.

## Turn-in Instructions

Electronic turn-in instructions:

We will use turnin to manage lab assignment submissions. Go to the parent
directory of the directory `lab6/` where you deposited the submissions and type
the command

```sh
turnin -v -c cs536 -p lab6 lab6
```

This lab is an individual effort. Please note the assignment submission policy
specified on the course home page.
