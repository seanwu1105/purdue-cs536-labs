# [Lab 4: Enhancements to Transport Layer Protocols](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/park/cs536/lab4/lab4.html)

## Objective

The first objective of this lab is to implement a performance oriented but
lightweight reliable file transport protocol. The second objective is to
facilitate improved client authentication in the framework of public-key and
symmetric key cryptosystems by utilizing basic crytographic primitives.

## Reading

Read chapters 4 and 5 from Peterson & Davie (textbook).
