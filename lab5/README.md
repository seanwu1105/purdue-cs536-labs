# [Lab 5: Congestion Control for Audio Streaming](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/park/cs536/lab5/lab5.html)

## Objective

The aim of this lab is to implement feedback congestion control for pseudo
real-time multimedia streaming. To not get sidetracked by video/audio encoding
standards and related issues, we will use audio streaming which allows us to
focus on the networking components. The same methods apply to video streaming.

## Reading

Read chapters 5 and 6 from Peterson & Davie.

## Turn-in Instructions

Electronic turn-in instructions:

We will use turnin to manage lab assignment submissions. Go to the parent
directory of the directory `lab5/` where you deposited the submissions and type
the command

```sh
turnin -v -c cs536 -p lab5 lab5
```
