# Bonus Problem (40 pts)

Add a new control law, method E, selected by value 2 of the method parameter in
the client's command-line arguments. The aim is improve upon the performance of
method D. Describe your control method and its rationale in `lab5.pdf`. Try to
be creative which starts with clearly stating the motivation. Even though an
idea may seem reasonable, whether it actually pans out is another matter.
Implement the method and evaluate its performance by comparing to the results of
Problem 1. Submit the extended code in `v2/`. If Problem 1 is tackled as a group
effort, the bonus problem must be solved as a group effort as well.
